# ChatChat - TheChatApplication

## Installations:
1. Qt4 designer
2. Python 2.7

## Details:
The chat application has two main componets, the *client* and the *server*. <br/>
Apart from sending regular text data, this application can also generate widgets notifying the successful transmission of 
files such as video, audio, images, executable files etc. This application uses Sockets for implementing the TCP/IP protocol.
Transmission of text data between the server and the clients is made possible when a connection is established between them 
by using TCP sockets. <br/>
This application has been designed to work under any LINUX and WINDOWS system with Qt4 designer installed in it, 
and under common network using TCP/IP protocol.
